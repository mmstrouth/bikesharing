# Bikesharing Comes to Des Moines

## Overview of the Analysis
After visiting New York City, my partner, Kate, and I were inspired to create a proposal for a bikesharing business in our hometown of Des Moines. While there are some noteable differences between the cities, we believe data from Citi Bike in NYC provide generalizable lessons we can adapt in our endeavor.

## Results
We first invite you to visit our dashboard via the link below. This file will breakdown each visualization from the NYC data and relate it to our project in Des Moines.

While considering a business endeavor involving renting bikes, it is important to explore the demographics of the users in other successful cities like NYC. In just one month, August 2019, Citi Bike saw 2,344,224 rides. That's just one month! The gender breakdown reveals that men are more likely to rent the bikes which may have implications for size and type of bikes available. In addition, the last graph shows the ages of riders.

The next visualizations, called heatmaps, reflect the time of day that the rental ended, first displaying the overall data, followed by a gender breakdown. The darker red color indicates a larger amount of stoptimes. We can see distinct increases around commuting times: 6AM - 9AM and 4PM - 7PM. We think we would see similar patterns in Des Moines as the work days of Iowans are similar to New Yorkers. The gendered visualization once again reflects more male-identifying users.

We believe the following visualizations is one of the most important to consider when evaluating the success of such a business in Des Moines. One might be concerned that Citi Bike is so popular because NYC is a tourist destination and Des Moines is ... not. Alas, the visualization below shows that "Subscribers", who are definitely not tourists, make up a very large portion of users. Des Moines could look forward to a very similar clientele. This visualization also shows that subscribers use the service more heavily during weekdays, as we would expect with those using the bikes to commute to and from work.

The last two visualizations reflect the trip duration. These data have implications for the number of bikes we may need to ensure are available.

## Summary
Citi Bike is a success bike-sharing business in New York City. We believe a similar business could be popular in Des Moines. The data tell a story of who uses the bikes, when they use them, and what they use them for. We believe we would see similar patterns in Des Moines which could inform purchasing of equipment (type and number), as well as the importance of are target audience: business commuters. 
For a more in-depth analysis we would suggest the following two additional visualizations we would want to see performed on the available data:
-A visualization showing the gender breakdown by user type and birth year.
-A visualization of trip duration by birth year. 
We also suggest looking at additional months as August is a hot month in NYC and one ripe with tourists. We think it would be important to analyze usage during colder months to see its impact on ridership.
